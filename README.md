# GalvaSim ⚡

## Overview 🌟

**GalvaSim** is a tool designed to simulate how a galvanic (or electrochemical) cell behaves under different conditions. Whether you're a student learning about electrochemistry 📚 or a researcher needing a quick way to visualize and calculate electrochemical reactions 🧑‍🔬, this simulator can help you understand the processes behind these reactions, including how temperature 🌡️, pressure 💨, solvent 🧪, catalyst ⚙️, and pH 🧫 affect cell performance.

The simulator uses several scientific Python libraries, making it a great resource for anyone working with scientific simulations. 

## Key Features 🔑

### Input Modes 🎮
You can choose from three different modes depending on how much control you want over the simulation:

- **Manual Mode:** You provide all the values, like electrode materials, concentrations, and moles of reactant.
- **Auto Mode:** The program suggests the best electrodes, concentrations, and moles based on the conditions.
- **Mixed Mode:** A balance between manual input and auto-calculation. You can choose which values to input and which ones the program will calculate.

### Environmental Settings 🌍
The simulator lets you customize the following environmental factors:

- **Temperature (K):** Affects reaction rates and cell potential.
- **Pressure (atm):** Influences electrochemical reactions.
- **Solvent:** Choose from solvents like Water, Methanol, or Ethanol.
- **Catalyst:** Select a catalyst like Platinum or Nickel to boost the reaction.
- **pH:** Adjust the pH level to simulate different conditions.

### Simulation Parameters ⚙️
The simulation is based on key parameters defining the cell’s behavior:

- **Anode and Cathode Materials:** These materials determine the overall reaction and cell potential.
- **Concentrations:** The concentration of reactants impacts the cell’s potential.
- **Moles of Reactant:** The amount of reactant determines the total charge transfer.

### Detailed Cell Potential Calculation 🔋
The simulator calculates the cell potential using:

- **Nernst Equation:** Adjusts the potential based on concentration and temperature.
- **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, pressure, and pH.
- **Catalysts:** Improve reaction efficiency and cell potential.

## Example Usage 📝

### Manual Mode ✍️
In **Manual Mode**, you get full control over all parameters.

#### How to use Manual Mode:
1. Select the anode and cathode materials.
2. Enter the concentrations for both compartments.
3. Specify the moles of reactant.
4. (Optional) Adjust temperature, pressure, and solvent settings.
5. Run the simulation to see the results, such as cell potential and charge transfer.

### Auto Mode 🤖
In **Auto Mode**, the program will automatically suggest the best values for materials, concentrations, and moles of reactant.

#### How to use Auto Mode:
1. Select Auto Mode.
2. The program will pick the optimal electrodes.
3. It will calculate the optimal concentrations and moles.
4. Run the simulation to see the results.

### Mixed Mode ⚖️
**Mixed Mode** offers a balance, where you control some parameters manually and let the program calculate others.

#### How to use Mixed Mode:
1. Select Mixed Mode.
2. Choose which parameters to input manually.
3. The program will calculate the remaining parameters.
4. Run the simulation to review the results.
