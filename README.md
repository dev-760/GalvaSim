# GalvaSim

## Overview
GalvaSim is a tool designed to simulate how a galvanic (or electrochemical) cell behaves under different conditions. Whether you're a student learning about electrochemistry or a researcher needing a quick way to visualize and calculate electrochemical reactions, this simulator can help you understand the processes behind these reactions, including how temperature, pressure, solvent, catalyst, and pH affect cell performance.

You can control the simulation in a variety of ways: by entering all values manually, letting the program suggest the best values, or mixing both approaches for flexibility. Plus, the tool generates clear, visual outputs that make it easy to understand the results.

The simulator is built using several scientific Python libraries, which are widely used for calculations, modeling, and visualization in research and academia. This makes the simulator a great resource for anyone working with scientific simulations.

## Key Features
1. **Input Modes:**
   You can choose from three different modes, depending on how much control you want over the simulation:
   - **Manual Mode:** You provide all the values, like electrode materials, concentrations, and moles of reactant. This mode is great if you want to dig into the details and control every aspect of the simulation.
   - **Auto Mode:** The program will take care of everything. It will suggest the best electrodes, concentrations, and moles of reactant based on the conditions. Perfect if you want to quickly test a simulation without worrying about the details.
   - **Mixed Mode:** This is a balance between the first two modes. You can pick and choose which values you want to input manually and which ones the program should calculate for you.

2. **Environmental Settings:**
   The simulator lets you customize the following environmental factors, which influence the results:
   - **Temperature (K):** This affects reaction rates and cell potential. You can adjust the temperature to simulate different conditions.
   - **Pressure (atm):** Like temperature, pressure can influence electrochemical reactions. You can change this to see how it affects the results.
   - **Solvent:** Different solvents (e.g., Water, Methanol, Ethanol) can change the behavior of the cell, and you can select the one that fits your needs.
   - **Catalyst:** Some materials, like Platinum or Nickel, can boost the reaction. You can choose a catalyst to see how it improves performance.
   - **pH:** The pH level can significantly change how electrochemical reactions happen. You can modify it to simulate different conditions.

3. **Simulation Parameters:**
   The simulation is based on several key parameters that define how the cell behaves:
   - **Anode and Cathode materials:** These are the materials at the two electrodes. Their properties determine the overall reaction and cell potential.
   - **Concentrations:** The concentration of reactants in the anode and cathode compartments impacts the cell’s potential. You can adjust these for more accurate simulations.
   - **Moles of Reactant:** The amount of reactant determines the total charge transfer in the cell. You can enter this manually or let the program suggest an optimal value.

4. **Detailed Cell Potential Calculation:**
   One of the key outputs of the simulator is the cell potential, which tells you how much energy can be generated by the cell under different conditions. The program calculates this potential by considering:
   - The Nernst Equation, which adjusts the potential based on concentration and temperature.
   - Environmental factors like temperature, pressure, and pH, which modify the base potential.
   - The presence of a catalyst, which can improve the reaction efficiency and cell potential.

## Example Usage
### Manual Mode:
In Manual Mode, you get to decide everything. You pick the anode and cathode materials, input their concentrations, and enter the moles of reactant. You also have the option to adjust environmental settings like temperature, solvent, and pH.

#### How to use Manual Mode:
1. Select the anode and cathode materials.
2. Enter the concentrations for both compartments.
3. Specify the moles of reactant.
4. (Optional) Adjust temperature, pressure, and solvent settings.
5. Run the simulation to see the results, like cell potential and charge transfer.

### Auto Mode:
In Auto Mode, the program does the hard work for you. It suggests the best materials, concentrations, and moles of reactant based on the conditions you set. This mode is ideal for quick simulations when you don’t need to adjust everything yourself.

#### How to use Auto Mode:
1. Select Auto Mode.
2. The program automatically picks the optimal electrodes based on their reduction potentials.
3. It calculates the optimal concentrations for the anode and cathode.
4. It also suggests the number of moles of reactant for an ideal simulation.
5. Run the simulation and see the results.

### Mixed Mode:
In Mixed Mode, you can select which parameters you want to input manually and which ones you want the program to calculate. This mode gives you the best of both worlds: flexibility and convenience.

#### How to use Mixed Mode:
1. Select Mixed Mode.
2. Choose which parameters you want to input manually (e.g., anode material, concentration) and which ones you want the program to calculate (e.g., cathode material, moles of reactant).
3. The program will automatically fill in the missing values.
4. Run the simulation and review the results.

## Built with Scientific Python
This simulator is built with scientific Python, which means it uses some of the best libraries in the field of scientific computing. These libraries make the simulation fast, accurate, and easy to use:
- **numpy:** This library helps with all the number crunching, from simple math to more complex calculations. It’s perfect for dealing with the arrays and mathematical operations involved in electrochemical simulations.
- **matplotlib:** For visualizing the data. Whether you want to create static graphs or interactive plots, matplotlib lets you easily visualize the results of your simulation.
- **networkx:** While not heavily used in the current version, networkx is great for modeling and analyzing networks. If you ever expand the simulator, you can use this library to model more complex systems of reactions.
- **rich:** This library adds style and formatting to the console output. It makes the simulation more interactive and user-friendly with features like colored text, tables, and prompts.
- **dataclasses:** Used to create simple classes that store data. This makes organizing the environmental settings and simulation parameters easier.
- **enum:** This is used to define constant values, like the input modes (manual, auto, mixed), making the code more readable and organized.

These libraries are commonly used in the scientific Python ecosystem, which is widely used in fields like data science, engineering, and academic research. So if you're working in electrochemistry or any other scientific field, this simulator fits right in with the tools you already use.
